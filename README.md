# React-Portfolio
My React Personal Portfolio

## Description
This my first professional profile created using React. It contains my past and present experience and skills I learned as a Bootcamp student. I used the React Portfolio to showcase my work as a Front-End Web developer.

I learned to use Fluid design or responsive design to make sure website scale with the size of the screen, this way
no matter the size of your screen, the html tag will shrink or expand accordingly and not break the page and to use
@media breakpoints in Css for different screen size, so that no matter what device (mobile, Desktop or Laptop), it on
the web page will display perfectly.

## Installation
As you click on each button it will take you to the the page/section where you can view the full page. The projects page displays all my work while the contact page displays a contact me form. The experience page shows my background and education experience.
